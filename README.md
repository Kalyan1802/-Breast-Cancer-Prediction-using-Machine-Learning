# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to build and compare multiple machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and identify the best-performing classifier.
Project Workflow

--> Data Preprocessing:
Loaded dataset from sklearn.datasets
Checked for missing values and balanced classes
Standardized features for model training

--> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized class distribution
Correlation heatmap of features
Feature importance ranking

--> Model Building
Implemented and compared:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest

--> Model Evaluation
Metrics: Accuracy
Confusion matrix
